playbook2 is to create a docker image from the docker file and war file, tag that image and push that image to the docker hub and remove that image from the ansible server (alll these are done in local server only)

note ssh connectivity between ansadmin in localserver and also localhost to do these

ssh-copy-id localhost

playbook3 is to pull the image from the docker hub, create container from that image on the target server

commands:

ansible-playbook -i /opt/ansible/localhost /opt/docker/playbook2.yml

ansible-playbook -i /opt/docker/hosts /opt/docker/playbook3.yml

note: create two hosts file
one for localhost (ansible to perform all tasks in localhost) and one for target hosts( for deploying code into target servers)

create an ansadmin user in ansible server..these user is added to the group docker so that ansible able to create docker images

create a directory for workspace of docker images lets create it on /opt/docker you can create anywhere

change ownership to ansadmin

chown -R ansadmin:ansadmin /opt/docker
